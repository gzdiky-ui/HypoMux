HypoMux v2.0 is a multi-network-adapter bandwidth aggregation and download acceleration tool built for Windows. It is designed for multi-connection download workloads where traffic can be distributed across several active network interfaces.

Version 2.0 adds a **Virtual NIC mode** alongside the original system proxy mode, giving HypoMux a more stable way to capture and split traffic across a wider range of applications. It also introduces **split tunneling rules**, so selected processes can be sent through the multi-NIC aggregation path or kept on a direct/bypass route for low-latency use cases.

In system proxy mode, HypoMux uses L3 socket binding (IP_UNICAST_IF) with a dual-protocol local proxy engine. In Virtual NIC mode, HypoMux temporarily adjusts Windows proxy and routing-related settings, sends accelerated traffic into the local core, and lets non-accelerated traffic pass directly through advanced split tunneling rules. This makes it useful for high-concurrency scenarios such as Steam updates, IDM large-file downloads, WeGame downloads, and browser-based transfers.

In simpler terms, as long as your computer is connected to multiple networks at the same time (for example, **being plugged into a school or home Ethernet cable while also connected to Wi-Fi, or using USB tethering from a phone**), HypoMux can distribute multi-threaded download connections across those networks. Single-connection downloads are still limited by the behavior of the download source.

##  Key Technical Features

* **Virtual NIC Mode**: New in v2.0, TUN-based traffic capture improves acceleration stability across more application types.
* **Per-Process Split Tunneling**: Route selected apps directly/bypassed or through the multi-NIC aggregation path, making download clients, game launchers, browsers, and low-latency apps easier to mix.
*  **Seamless Dual-Protocol Interception**: Starts asynchronous SOCKS5 and local HTTP forwarding services, then applies WinINet system proxy settings when acceleration begins.
*  **Fail-Safe Proxy Restore**: Manual stop, startup failure, and window close paths all attempt to restore the system proxy cleanly.
*  **5-Column Telemetry Matrix Grid**: Dynamically displays precise multi-path load distribution: [ Select | Adapter Alias | IPv4 Address | Real-time Speed (MB/s) | Active Connections ].
* ️ **Pure Async Groundwork**: All PowerShell network querying, background thread interface telemetry, and async DNS processing run entirely inside a detached event loop away from the main Qt UI thread.

## 📢 Important Notice & Compliance Disclaimer

HypoMux is a transparent, open-source network utility intended only for authorized use on the user's own devices and network connections. It is not designed or permitted for bypassing third-party access controls, network restrictions, platform rules, or any security measures without authorization.

Before using HypoMux, please be aware of the following behavior:

1. **System Changes**: While active, HypoMux may dynamically adjust Windows system proxy and/or routing-related settings so traffic can enter the acceleration core.
2. **Local Proxying**: Accelerated traffic is processed locally through the secure core for splitting, proxying, and multiplexing.
3. **Automatic Restoration**: Modified system proxy and network settings are restored automatically when the tool is stopped or uninstalled.
4. **Gaming & Split Tunneling**: HypoMux v2.0 introduces advanced split tunneling. For latency-sensitive applications such as competitive online games, users are strongly advised to add them to the **Direct/Bypass routing list** to preserve raw network latency, or suspend HypoMux during gameplay.

##  How to Use

1. **Hardware Setup**: Hook up your PC to multiple unique lines (e.g., **Broadband Lan Wire + Mobile Phone 5G Tethering Hotspot**).
2. **Choose a Mode**: Use system proxy mode for lightweight proxy-aware acceleration, or Virtual NIC mode when you want broader and more stable traffic capture.
3. **Select Interfaces**: Start HypoMux, wait for the background scan worker to finish, and **check the adapters you wish to use**.
4. **Configure Split Rules**: For games, voice chat, meetings, or other latency-sensitive apps, add their processes to the direct/bypass rules.
5. **Engage Acceleration**: Click **Boost**. Once the status switches to running, start your downloads or game updates.
6. **Graceful Teardown**: Click **Stop** or close HypoMux when done; modified network settings are restored automatically.

##  Supported Applications

Any multi-connection/multi-threaded client acknowledging standard Windows WinINet internet proxy server layouts will immediately benefit from concurrent aggregation:

* **Download Software**: **IDM (Internet Download Manager)**, Thunder (迅雷), Baidu NetDisk Client, etc.
* **Gaming Platforms**: **Steam Client Download Core**, Epic Games Launcher, EA App, Xbox Application.
* **Browsers**: Large file downloads via Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.

##  Technical Architecture

HypoMux's core distribution mechanism combines **Layer-4 application-level scheduling**, **Layer-3 physical socket binding**, and the v2.0 **Virtual NIC split-tunneling capture path**. System proxy mode covers applications that honor WinINet/system proxy settings, while Virtual NIC mode extends coverage through a local network sidecar and advanced routing rules.

```

1. **Dual Ingress Modes**: System proxy mode writes the local proxy chain to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings`: `http=127.0.0.1:10801;https=127.0.0.1:10801;socks=127.0.0.1:10800`; Virtual NIC mode uses TUN capture and advanced split rules to cover more application traffic.
2. **Low-Level Dual Binding**: When the distribution engine receives a TCP connection from a download client, the scheduler pins the local NIC IPv4 address via `socket.bind()` and sends `setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, 31, ...)` to the system kernel to force-lock the physical interface index, stripping traffic away from the default gateway to achieve true physical multi-channel concurrency.
3. **Advanced Split Tunneling**: v2.0 can route processes through either the aggregation path or a direct path. Download workloads can use stacked bandwidth, while latency-sensitive apps can stay direct.

## ️ Security & Technical Boundaries

1. **Anti-Cheat Notice**: This tool operates at the standard application-layer proxy and network socket binding level. **It does not touch game memory, intercept or modify any game private network packets, or inject any DLL drivers**.
2. **Single-Thread Connection Limitation**: Multi-NIC concurrent aggregation is fundamentally **multi-connection load balancing**. If your download task is the extremely rare single-thread TCP connection, no multi-NIC aggregation tool can accelerate it.
3. **Low-Latency Gaming Advisory**: Multi-NIC distribution is optimized for download throughput. Before playing latency-sensitive competitive online games (e.g. *CS2*, *Valorant*, *GTA Online*), add the related process to the **Direct/Bypass routing list**, or click **Stop** so the PC returns to its normal network path.
